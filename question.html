    <!-- This is the page where the user types a post. 
        Here, we'll need:
        1. A navbar
        2. Boxes to enter the title and content of the post
            - What's entered here needs to be carried into the answer page
        3. Styling options for the text (if do-able)
            - i.e. a small bar at the top of the box with options like bold, underline, italicize, etc.
        4. Post button
        5. CSS detailing
    -->
