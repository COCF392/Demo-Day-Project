    <!-- This is the page the user is taken to after they have posted. 
        Here, we'll need:
        1. A navbar
        2. Left side options
        3. The user's post at the top
        4. Responses underneath (usually smaller than the main post)
        5. Voting buttons
        6. Other fake accounts
        5. CSS Detailing
